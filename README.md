## üí° How it Works

### Watch Model

Each watch is represented by a WatchModel class that holds details like:

- `name` : The name of the watch.
- `kind` : The type of watch (analog, digital, chronograph).
- `fashion` : The fashion category (casual, formal, etc.).
- `ammount` : The price of the watch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- **Detailed Watch View :** Clicking the "Next" button could navigate to a detailed page of the watch with more specifications.
- **Filtering :** Add a filter to search by watch type (analog, digital, chronograph) or price range.
- **API Integration :** Fetch real-time data from a watch-related API instead of using static data.
